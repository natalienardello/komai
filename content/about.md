Ray Komai: Architectural Forum covers, 1953–1963 presents large images of 46 covers of
Architectural Forum magazine that were designed by Ray Komai. The project includes an
introduction and brief descriptions of each cover. Embedded in the cover descriptions are
related photographs from the original issues, as well as links to scans of the full magazines on
the website of usmodernist.org.<br><br>
This project accompanies a book about Ray Komai by Doug Clouse of the Graphics Office,
published by Counselor Books (https://amzn.to/2CSlKLM), and was inspired by an exhibition
based on the book at Fordham University in 2019. The magazine covers were the most popular
visual element in the exhibition but there was not room in the exhibition to provide descriptions
of each cover. This project presents those descriptions, while also providing The Graphics
Office an opportunity explore the online publishing. Online publishing offers museums
opportunities to share information and exhibitions in new ways.<br><br>
