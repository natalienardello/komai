A schematic evocation of urban movement illustrates this report from a panel discussion about how to rebuild city centers.
“The shabby, dull, dingy condition that is overtaking our central cities can no longer be tolerated now that the people are being given a new vision of shopping in the country, living in the country, working in the country. Now that new outlying housing developments and indeed new towns spring up overnight, now that there is a migration not only of factories but of large office buildings out into the grass, now that the life-blood of the older center appears to be drained out along every superhighway, the time has come for a major decision whether or not to carry on with the central downtown district of the metropolitan city, and how.” (p. 123 of the issue)
