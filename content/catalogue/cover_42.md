Ray’s typographic skyline for an issue about architecture in Chicago was his favorite cover for Architectural Forum. It was chosen for “Graphic Arts USA,” the exhibition of American graphic design that was organized by the United States Information Service. For the exhibition, the English masthead was replaced with a Russian version that read “Artistic Design.” In 1963 the exhibition opened in Kazakstan, visited Moscow and two other cities in 1964, and completed its tour in Romania in 1965. The cover was Ray’s calling card to the diplomatic world; in 1963 Ray went to work full-time for the United States Information Service.
