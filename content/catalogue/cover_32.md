Drawing by Ray Komai of Detroit’s Lafayette Park. Mies van der Rohe designed several of the residential buildings in Lafayette Park. This cover reveals another link (see page 109) between American design in the middle of the twentieth century and the Japanese- American incarceration camps. One of the primary architects in Mies’s office was Joseph Fujikawa (1922–2003), who spent time in a camp in Colorado.
