The cover drawing by Komai was inspired by the crystalline molecular structure of an aluminum compound.
Note a change in the magazine masthead, now cast in the typeface Craw Clarendon. A promotional booklet for the company that made the typeface, American Type Founders, featured a photograph of Komai and stated that “Craw Clarendon’s suitability as a part of a modern architectural or display structure is evident in Komai’s choice of this face for the cover of Architectural Forum as well as for editorial display lines in the magazine. The further use of the type for the magazine’s letterhead and for its promotional printing has established for Architectural Forum an appropriate and consistent recognition as well as an overall identity.”
