Cover design for an issue devoted to the topic of city planning, specifically planning for 1976, twenty years in the future:
“The last ten years have given us an unholy mess of land use, land coverage, congestion and ugliness. This is nothing to what the next twenty promise. Barring annihilation, deep depression, or a more tractable invention supplanting the automobile, we have no way to avert this crisis of growth, no choice but to face it and try to civilize it. Somehow. And not much time to do it.”
