This simple illustration for an issue devoted to city planning for 1976, twenty years into the future, hints at the urban footprint as well as traffic congestion:
“The last ten years have given us an unholy mess of land use, land coverage, congestion and ugliness. This is nothing to what the next twenty promise. Barring annihilation, deep depression, or a more tractable invention supplanting the automobile, we have no way to avert this crisis of growth, no choice but to face it and try to civilize it. Somehow. And not much time to do it.” (p. 103)
