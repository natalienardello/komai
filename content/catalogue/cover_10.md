Komai’s illustration was inspired by wall decoration in the Santa Fe home of Alexander and Susan Girard.
The accompanying article, illustrated with photographs by Charles Eames, wryly comments on the contrast between conventional modernism and the Girard’s home:
“What has become of the that holy household word uncluttered? The answer is that Alexander Girard has swallowed it, and smiled. In a modern period that is fast becoming perfunctory, he has gone his own way, collecting objects around the world which interest or amuse him. … The house has no central heating but it does not lack a central culture, catholicity.” (p. 132)
