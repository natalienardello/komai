This cover uses a mercator projection map to illustrate the article “US building abroad: As ambassador to the world, the industry is building everything from radio towers to new towns — including good will.”
Eight years after designing this cover, Komai would leave Architectural Forum to work for the United States Information Service, which helped spread American ideas and values around the world.
