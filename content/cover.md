Ray Komai, an American graphic designer and exhibition designer, was born in California in 1918. In 1942–43 he and his wife were incarcerated in Manzanar, one of the camps the United States government built for Japanese-Americans following the attack on Pearl Harbor. After release from Manzanar, Komai went east, eventually landing in New York City. There he worked for a variety of advertising, furniture, broadcasting, and magazine publishing businesses. Ironically, Komai then became a designer for the United States Information Service, a federal agency that promoted American values during the Cold War. USIS jobs led Komai to postings in India, Europe, and even Japan, where his work helped explain and defend democracy and life in the United States.<br><br>

Admired by his colleagues for his industry, humor, and talent, Komai’s design work was meticulous yet expressive. His spirit and innate sense of graphic contrast and balance attracted considerable attention and many commissions. He designed in both two and three dimensions in variations of the modernist idiom, from American commercial modernism to the supergraphics and orderly international style of the 1960s and 70s. A survey of Komai’s work reveals a career that transcended narrow national and racial identities. After a long career associated with renowned design offices and projects, he died in Switzerland in 2010.

In 2019 Fordham University in New York hosted an exhibition of Komai’s work, documented here. This site focusses on Komai’s cover design for Architectural Forum magazine in the 1950s and 60s in more detail than was possible in the exhibition.
