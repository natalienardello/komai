However, his design is notable and his career was influenced by dramatic cultural and political events. He is one of a group of Japanese-American artists and designers, including Isamu Noguchi, Tomoko Miho, and Ruth Asawa, who were incarcerated in prison camps during World War II. This group made important contributions to American visual arts, despite their treatment by the US government during the war. Komai’s career invites reflection on immigration, patriotism, and bias.\nThis website focuses on one body of work from Komai's time in New York City, before he left the US to work for the USIS in India. These cover designs for Architectural Forum magazine have an obvious visual appeal: some covers look like what we expect of mid-century design, while others are late enough and personal enough that they also have a bluntness and slight awkwardness that signals evolving design trends. The covers track a personal aesthetic course between contemporary visual art and the practical demands of commercial design. Some look like Philip Guston paintings (February 1958 and November 1960) and others suggest Pop Art (March and October 1963). Cover lettering and illustrations recall the work of illustrator Ben Shahn and artist Edward Ruscha. May 1962’s cover (Komai’s favorite) appears to originate in Komai’s own intuitive respect for structure and practice of typography.\n Ray Komai exhibition at Fordham University.

In 1942–43 he and his wife were incarcerated in Manzanar, one of the camps the United States government built for Japanese-Americans following the attack on Pearl Harbor. After release from Manzanar, the couple went east, eventually landing in New York City. There, Komai worked for a variety of advertising, furniture, broadcasting, and magazine publishing businesses. Ironically, Komai then became a designer for the United States Information Service, a federal agency that promoted American values during the Cold War. USIS jobs led Komai to postings in India, Europe, and even Japan, where his work helped explain and defend democracy and life in the United States.\nAdmired by his colleagues for his industry, humor, and talent, Komai’s design work was meticulous yet expressive. His spirit and innate sense of graphic contrast and balance attracted considerable attention and many commissions. A survey of Komai’s work reveals a career that transcended narrow national and racial stereotypes. After a long career associated with renowned design offices and projects, he died in Switzerland in 2010.\nIn 2019 Fordham University in New York hosted an exhibition of Komai’s work, documented here. This site focuses on Komai’s cover designs for Architectural Forum magazine in the 1950s and 60s in more detail than was possible in the exhibition.

It became Architectural Forum in 1917 and stopped publishing in 1974. During Komai’s tenure at the magazine, it was owned by Time, Inc., with founder Henry Luce serving as Editor in Chief. Forum’s subject matter was unusually specific, its circulation small, and its returns meager compared to the famous general-interest magazines in Luce’s stable, including Fortune, Life, House \u0026amp; Home, and Sports Illustrated.\nWriters and editors at Architectural Forum analyzed and critiqued American architecture and urban planning. Some issues featured new buildings on its covers, while others were devoted to larger themes of urban planning, particular building types (schools were a favorite), individual cities, and the general architectural profession. These ambitious themed issues required more symbolic and original cover designs, which are some of Komai’s strongest.\nRay Komai’s name enters the staff list of Architectural Forum as Associate Art Director in May, 1952, after he had worked as a designer at CBS for six years. Komai went to Forum as a “kind of retirement:” a comfortable, calm place to work after the pressure of working at CBS. Accounts of Komai's time at the magazine come to us from some of the accomplished people who went through its offices, such as graphic designer Peter Bradford and editor/writer/architect Peter Blake. Following are all 46 of Ray Komai’s striking covers, designed between 1953 and 1963.\nCatalog of Covers   ","id":1,"length":257,"title":"Architectural Forum Covers","type":"contents","url":"https://natalienardello.github.io/komai/catalogue/"},{"content":"A cover for a special issue on education.

The project includes an introduction and brief descriptions of each cover. Embedded in the cover descriptions are related photographs from the original issues, as well as links to scans of the full magazines on the website of usmodernist.org.\nThis project accompanies a book about Ray Komai by Doug Clouse of the Graphics Office, published by Counselor Books, and was inspired by an exhibition based on the book at Fordham University in 2019. The magazine covers were the most popular visual element in the exhibition but there was not room in the exhibition to provide descriptions of each cover. This project presents those descriptions, while also providing The Graphics Office an opportunity explore the online publishing. Online publishing offers museums opportunities to share information and exhibitions in new ways.\nCitation Information TBD\nPermanent URL TBD\nRevision History Revisions after the first edition date will be listed here August XX, 2020 First edition\nCopyright © 2020 The Graphics Office Published by The Graphics Office 769 Carroll Street, #4 Brooklyn, NY 11215 Doug Clouse and Angela Voulangas: Editing and Art Direction Natalie Nardello, Design and Development\nExhibition Photography: Stephan Apicella-Hitchcock Other photography and scans: Doug Clouse and usmodernist.com\n","id":50,"length":217,"title":"About","type":"page","url":"https://natalienardello.github.io/komai/about/"}]
