In 1942–43 he and his wife were incarcerated in Manzanar, one of the camps the United States government built for Japanese-Americans following the attack on Pearl Harbor. After release from Manzanar, Komai went east, eventually landing in New York City. There he worked for a variety of advertising, furniture, broadcasting, and magazine publishing businesses. Ironically, Komai then became a designer for the United States Information Service, a federal agency that promoted American values during the Cold War. USIS jobs led Komai to postings in India, Europe, and even Japan, where his work helped explain and defend democracy and life in the United States.\nAdmired by his colleagues for his industry, humor, and talent, Komai’s design work was meticulous yet expressive. His spirit and innate sense of graphic contrast and balance attracted considerable attention and many commissions. He designed in both two and three dimensions in variations of the modernist idiom, from American commercial modernism to the supergraphics and orderly international style of the 1960s and 70s. A survey of Komai’s work reveals a career that transcended narrow national and racial identities. After a long career associated with renowned design offices and projects, he died in Switzerland in 2010.\nIn 2019 Fordham University in New York hosted an exhibition of Komai’s work, documented here. This site focusses on Komai’s cover design for Architectural Forum magazine in the 1950s and 60s in more detail than was possible in the exhibition.\n Photo for the Ray Komai exhibit at Fordham University.

It became Architectural Forum in 1917 and stopped publishing in 1974. During Komai’s tenure at the magazine, it was owned by Time, Inc., with founder Henry Luce serving as Editor in Chief. Forum’s subject matter was unusually specific, its circulation small, and its returns meager compared to the famous general-interest magazines in Luce’s stable, including Fortune, Life, House \u0026amp; Home, and Sports Illustrated.\nWriters and editors at Architectural Forum analyzed and critiqued American architecture and urban planning. Some issues featured new buildings on its covers, while others were devoted to larger themes of urban planning, particular building types (schools were a favorite), individual cities, and the general architectural profession. These ambitious themed issues required more symbolic and original cover designs, which are some of Komai’s strongest.\nRay Komai’s name enters the staff list of Architectural Forum as Associate Art Director in May, 1952. Komai went to Forum as a “kind of retirement:” a comfortable, calm place to work after the pressure of working at CBS. Accounts of Komai's time at the magazine come to us from some of the accomplished people who went through its offices, such as graphic designer Peter Bradford and editor/writer/architect Peter Blake. Following are all 46 of Ray Komai’s striking covers, designed between 1953 and 1963.\nCatalouge of Covers  ","id":1,"length":247,"title":"Architectural Forum Covers","type":"contents","url":"https://natalienardello.github.io/komai/catalogue/"},{"content":"A cover for a special issue on education.

Now that new outlying housing developments and indeed new towns spring up overnight, now that there is a migration not only of factories but of large office buildings out into the grass, now that the life-blood of the older center appears to be drained out along every superhighway, the time has come for a major decision whether or not to carry on with the central downtown district of the metropolitan city, and how.” (p. 123 of the issue) Full issue\n Attendees at a St. Louis round table on rebuilding urban downtowns.

With a few minutes to spare before the printer threatened to shut down the presses, Ray Komai walked into our offices and unwrapped what looked like an odd sort of pillow: he had sewn together a wonderfully zany fake ‘souvenir’ — a kind of pillow case of the sort that souvenir peddlers might (but never did) sell to Washington’s millions of tourists.”\nFormer staff designer Peter Bradford, then no longer at Architectural Forum but working nearby, wrote of this cover: “\u0026hellip;they called me and I ran over.
